=======================
Proto-Mesh/Auditor-Node
=======================

##Description

This sub section of proto-mesh concerns using testing features using batctl options.\
This module will translate the output into json objects for better use with other database utility. \
The auditor node will be run as a regular node on the mesh and will run in the background.

##File Structure

The **TestScripts/** directory holds the runnable and bash script testing files.\
These scripts drive the functionality of auditor-node.

The **TestOutput/** directory holds the output files from each test script.

###TestScripts

Many of these scripts are labeled batctl after their batctl collection component.\

###TestOutput

The files and the directories within this folder is generated by each of the test scripts.\
The directoryand file organization is as such:

```bash
$TestDirectory/$TestAcronym_$Date/$TestAcronym_$Date[From_$StartTime][For_$TestDuration].txt
```

##Usage

Simply run:

```bash
sudo sh run_all_scripts.sh $1
```

where $1 is an integer value of how many minutes you wish to run the tests.

Alternatively you may run each test individually in the same format.


##TODO:

- Add more tests
- Add test flags
- Improve jsonification
- High level error checking
- Direct database integration
